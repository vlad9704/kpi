</p>
<p>
	 -&nbsp;The first project in the Republic of Kazakhstan for the processing of raw materials from the Tengiz field.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
	 -&nbsp;Production capacity of 500 thousand tons of polypropylene per year.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
</p>
<p>
	 −&nbsp;About 1% of the global production of polypropylene.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
</p>
<p>
	 −&nbsp;26.3% of the total production of polypropylene in the Russian Federation.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
</p>
<p>
	 -&nbsp;More than the total production of polypropylene in the territory of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
</p>
<p>
 <b>- Raw material:</b> propane from the Tengiz field, purified from harmful impurities, which minimizes the impact on the environment.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 <b>
	- Technologies used:</b> Catofin (propane dehydrogenation) and Novolen (propylene polymerization) technologies from Lummus Technology Inc. (USA).
</p>
<p>
 <br>
	 - Similar complexes have been built in 5 countries of the world (Saudi Arabia, USA, Belgium, South Korea and China).
</p>
<p>
 <br>
</p>
<p>
	 - 77% of the equipment is produced by manufacturers in Europe, the USA, South Korea, Japan and India.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Workplaces:</b>
</p>
<p>
 <br>
	 for the construction period (temporary) - more than 4,300;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
</p>
<p>
	 for the period of operation (permanent) - 1,100.

 <b>General Contractor</b>: China National Chemical Engineering Co. (CNCEC, China).
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 <b>The effect of the project implementation:</b>
</p>
<p>
 <br>
	 −&nbsp;Covering the internal needs of Kazakhstan (import substitution) in polypropylene (the market capacity of Kazakhstan is about 50 thousand tons per year).
</p>
<p>
 <br>
	 −&nbsp;Opportunity for SMEs to produce products from polypropylene for further processing in the sectors of construction, medicine, automotive, food industry, textile industry, etc.
</p>
<p>
	 −&nbsp;Creation of additional jobs in SMEs and related industries.
</p>
<p>
	 −&nbsp;The contribution to the country’s GDP will be up to 1%.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Current status:</b>
</p>
<p>
	 ·&nbsp;The overall progress of the project implementation is 99.74%.
</p>
<p>
	 ·&nbsp;Construction and installation work has been completed, off-site facilities, a propane drain rack and a propane storage park have been put into operation. Commissioning works are underway.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
	 ·&nbsp;Completion of commissioning with the production of the first batch of polypropylene is planned for november this year.
