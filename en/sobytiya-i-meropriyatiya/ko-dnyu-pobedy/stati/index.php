		<b>Kubashev Kumargali Kuanshalievich</b>
	</h6>
	<img src="/upload/medialibrary/b35/100-_1_.jpg" class="img-right">
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		In the family of a peasant Kubash, who lived in the village of Kyzylbas of the Zhanbai village council of the Novobogat district of the Guryev region, in September 1921 my grandfather Kumargali was born. He was the firstborn of his sons. Childhood was, like many of his peers, hungry and was accustomed to work early. In 1939, he graduated from high school in Sorochinka and enrolled in absentia at the Guryev Pedagogical School. There were not enough graduates, and at a rural school in Kumargali, ata began to teach rural children to read and write.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		In 1942 he was drafted into the Red Army, and was immediately sent to the front. Its military roads ran through the Baltic republics - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Here he fought not only with the Nazi occupiers, but also saboteurs. Kumargali ata served in the artillery troops. This kind of troops was not in vain called the «god of war». During the years of World War II, gunners became the main means of destroying not only the enemy’s manpower, but also its shock troops - tank formations.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		He was shell-shocked twice due to the explosion of German bombs. Despite this, he did not leave the battlefield, he fought with the enemy. He was awarded the «For Courage» medal on December 8, 1943 for participating in the fight on December 1, 1943 for a height of 164.4 in repelling an enemy attack and personally destroyed 5 German soldiers from the machine gun.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		In the war he joined the ranks of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		In March 1945, in a special direction, he entered the school for the training of artillery mortar officers. The combat description issued by the deputy commander of military unit №661 for artillery, Captain Vakhnyuktin, noted the following: «During his stay at the front from 1942 to 1945 he proved himself a disciplined, persistent and brave skilled fighter in the fight against the German invaders. Under enemy fire, he did not stop following the orders of his commander, correctly and accurately fired from his mortar at the enemy, for which he was awarded Government awards three times. Comrade Kubashev is politically educated, morally stable, and worthy of being an officer in the Red Army». The commander of the artillery regiment, Major Sokolov, fully agreed with this characteristic, as evidenced by his signature.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		The military way of Kumargali Kubashev is awarded with the orders of the Red Star, the Second World War, and many medals.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		It was not possible to complete his studies at Kumargali Kubashev school, and he returns home, and again begins to work at school. In February 1946, his father passed away, and the care of the younger school-age brothers fell on the shoulders of Kumargali Kubashev and his sister Rabiga. From 1946 to 1953 he worked as a teacher, the head of the schools of the settlements of Ushtagan, Zhambyl, Sarytobe. In 1953-1956 he worked as deputy director for the economic part of the secondary school named after Karl Marks in Dzhambul, chairman of the investigative commission of the 111 International collective farm, and freelance inspector of the district committee of the People’s Control. Since March 1956, he worked on the collective farm 111 International, then on the state farm Zaburun as a foreman, freight forwarder, farm manager, and head of the central warehouse, retired in 1982.
	</p>
	<img src="/upload/medialibrary/d16/thumbnail_ata-soldat.jpg" class="img-left">
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		In the mid-70s of the last century, he was offered to head a cooperative of state farm workers, to which he said: «This is a responsible job. I'm not afraid of even hard work. It will be difficult for me because this is a job where a lot of money and property. And where there is money, there will be no rest. No wonder they say that where money and politics go before, there is no truth.»  He did not want to have trouble and resigned from his post.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		The late Kumargali Kubashev instead of accumulating property and fame, preferred that his honor be spotless and that nothing bad was said behind his back. In life, he was demanding of himself and others. Many who knew Kumargali ata spoke with admiration about him.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		After returning from the war, Kumargali Kubashev married Farida Kazizkyzy from the Sebek Bozai clan. 9 children were born from them, the first-born Alpamys died at the age of five, and the youngest Yergali died at the age of one. Other children of Kumargali ata and Farida have already received good upbringing and education. All got their families. Kumargali ata was the head of a large family.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px">
		In life he was lucky. He managed to return unscathed from the terrible war, to pass with honor all the difficulties of military and peaceful life. To earn sincere respect from the people. Contribute to the education and upbringing of the young generation. Kumargali ata lived a great and happy life. He died in 1997.

They stepped into immortality, standing up for their homeland. Thousands of books have been written about their fortitude, courage, and heroism, hundreds of films have been made, museums have been opened, and the search continues. The history of the great Patriotic war is being updated with new materials and facts. And disputes between once-warring coalitions and allies do not fade away.  </i></b>

	<img src="/upload/medialibrary/1df/foto-Mikhaila-Ulitinavv.jpg" class="img-right">
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Mikhail Ulitin's front-line life is often remembered. Junior Sergeant Mikhail Ulitin has seen a lot in his military biography of the guard. He went through the entire war. He was called up in 1941 by the Guriev military enlistment office and sent to the 212th Guards howitzer artillery regiment of the 8th GGA Brigade of the Reserve of the Main Command.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		<i><b>Save the children</b></i>
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		There were many combat episodes, but the most memorable one was the one that happened to him in 1942. There were fierce battles on the South-Western front. Near Belgorod, Mikhail Ulitin, along with other fighters, was surrounded. Getting out of the encirclement, they came to a small village. In one of the houses where a young woman with a baby lived, Mikhail and his friend asked for shelter. The woman, without thinking, hid them behind the stove and covered them with straw. A minute later, a German burst into the house. When he saw the woman, he threw himself at her, trying to rape her. Here the baby began to cry, and the fascist, distracted from the woman, pointed the machine gun at the child. Mikhail, forgetting about his own safety, got out of hiding and shot the enemy.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Then there were long wanderings through the forest in search of their part. He was captured, escaped, and managed to survive.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		After the end of the war, returning to his hometown, Mikhail Ivanovich found that family. And once the family is Borodinym came to Guriev to visit Wliting. From the memoirs of Valentina Ulitina: «The Borodins (Mikhail and Sima) brought their children with them: a daughter, Lyuba, who was saved by her husband and a small son born after the war. Remembering that difficult time, we cried for a long time.»
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		«Proud of your father, he was very brave and selfless man,» - said Mikhail Borodin - says the eldest daughter Ulichnyh Hope, even though we were then very young, yet we understand that our father is a hero.»
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		The families corresponded for a long time. Luba Borodina graduated from the Leningrad medical Institute and later became a Professor of medicine.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		<i><b>Front-line roads</b></i>
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Mikhail Ulitin took part in combat operations since 1941. He was awarded the order of battle  «Red Star», medals «For military merit», «For the victory over Germany». Participated in the storming of Berlin.  On May 9, 1945, the war did not end for Mikhail Ulitin; his unit was sent to the far East, where the Soviet Union was preparing for combat operations with Japan. And since August, he has already taken part in the defeat of the Japanese army. Mikhail Ulitin's front-line roads ran through Mongolia and North Korea.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		From the submission №035452 (1944), signed by the commander, major of the 212th regiment Yurchenko: «During the breakthrough of the enemy's defense in the area of Buraki-Osipovka and the pursuit of the enemy in the direction of Senno, the first column, 500 meters East of Senno, was bombed from the air. A direct hit ignited two nearby cars and fuel tanks. The flames threatened to spread the fire to nearby cars. Guards Junior Sergeant Ulitin, neglecting life, with a raincoat in his hands, despite the burning personal uniforms, along with the driver Kalashnikov liquidated the fire of three cars and thus did not allow failure. At the second approach of the «Messers» of the guard, Junior Sergeant Ulitin, despite the machine-gun fire, started the staff car that was barely starting and brought it out of the fire, after putting two wounded officers on it, who were assisted by an infantry paramedic.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		We present to the guard Junior Sergeant Ulitin, the driver of the staff car to the government award-the order of the «Red Star».
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		On July 23, 1944, on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mikhail Ulitin was awarded the order of the «Red Star» for exemplary performance of command tasks at the front of the fight against the German invaders and for his valor and courage.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		And a little later, for special bravery and courage in the defense of the Fatherland, he was awarded the order of the red banner. With two orders and a military medal «For military merit» on his chest in the deep autumn of 1945, Mikhail Ulitin returned home.  
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		As his family recalls: «My grandfather told me that Soviet soldiers entered Berlin tired and emaciated, and he was also in this state. Our soldiers held on to finish off the fascist in his lair. He didn't even have socks or footcloths. He put on his boots on his bare feet, rubbing them until they bled. I searched the ruined houses for a piece of cloth to wrap my injured feet in, but I found clean German socks that had been mended. My grandfather didn't bring any trophies from the war. As he left in a single tunic, so he returned in a tunic, and got married in it. My grandparents also had many difficulties in the first years after the war. But this is how all the people lived.»
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		When Mikhail Ulitin was fighting at the front, his future wife Valentina worked as a radio operator.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		<i><b>Underground radio station</b></i>
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Before the war, Valentina Gorina graduated with honors from the Guriev Polytechnic and, having received a specialty as a radio operator, began working for the Central Telegraph. The message about the German attack on the Soviet Union, she received on the machine at which she worked. When the order for General mobilization was announced, Valentina asked to volunteer for the front. But it was refused, and it was sent by the radio operator to the special division of air observation, notification and communication of the city of Guryev. Valentina Gorina's service began to take place in an underground bunker in one of the buildings of the old city.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		- In this bunker there was a radio station on which we tracked the routes of enemy aircraft, and they flew very close, because Stalingrad, where there was fierce fighting, was nearby. The division was classified, and even my close relatives didn't know that I worked there, - Valentina Mikhailovna recalled.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		She spoke about her «underground» work  reluctantly.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		- We took an oath of non-disclosure of military secrets, and even after the incident for so many years, I can not give them up, - said Valentina Mikhailovna. 
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		But even from grandmother Vali meager recollections, as her grandchildren called her, her work was strenuous and responsible. Duty there was conducted around the clock, radio operators did not sleep at night, tracking the coordinates of enemy aircraft. During one of her duties, a foreign plane appeared in the sky near Guryev, maybe accidentally flew in. There was a commotion, but no major emergency occurred.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		The Ministry of Defense of the USSR highly appreciated Valentina's professional experience gained during the war, and after the end of the war, she was offered to move to Moscow at the disposal of the anti-aircraft forces, but she could not leave her sick mother and little brother.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		- For me, of course, it was a great honor to receive an invitation from the commander - in - chief of the air defense forces of the country, but I could not do anything else, - Valentina Mikhailovna recalled with sadness, - Life after the war was very difficult. We had to survive somehow. I was the oldest in the family, so all the care of the family fell on my shoulders. And it was hard to leave my hometown, where I was born and studied. So I refused. Sometimes I regret that I did not go to Moscow, my fate could have been completely different.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		In the post-war years, the profession of radio operator was in demand, and for many years she worked in the secret division of Guryev.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		<i><b>Family</b></i>
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		After the war, Mikhail Ulitin returned to the neighbor's house; Valentina remembered him as a boy. He returned home a scorched war veteran. A pretty girl Valya attracted Mikhail, and they decided to get married. They had two daughters and a son.
	</p>
	<img src="/upload/medialibrary/0fb/14141.jpg" class="img-left">	
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		For many years, Valentina Mikhailovna worked in the West Kazakhstan expedition of geophysical research of wells and the Caspian oil exploration expedition of the Guryevneftegazgeologiya JSC. Mikhail Ivanovich Ulitin himself worked as a chief mechanic, but unfortunately, the children do not remember which organization.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Over time, the children operated and flew out of the parental nest, creating their own families. Baba Valya was engaged in the upbringing of her grandchildren. There are nine of them. Valentina Mikhailovna waited for her grandchildren, but Mikhail Ivanovich Ulitin passed away early, at the age of 42. Received wounds in the war affected the health of the hero. Working underground as a radio operator also affected his health years later. With age, hearing is bad. Valentina Mikhailovna died in 2012.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		In recent years, she was offended that veterans were forgotten. «Oh, well. The most important thing is that there are children and grandchildren. And they don't forget me,» - she said.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Children of Mikhail and Valentina Ulitin cherish the memory of their parents. They pass on the stories that they have heard from their parents to their children, and they, in turn, to their children. The memory thread is not interrupted, and this is the main thing. It is priceless that on May 9, at the «Immortal regiment» their great-grandchildren will raise and carry portraits of Mikhail and Valentina Ulitin.

	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation is implementing the project «Memory Road», aimed at perpetuating the memory of participants in the Great Patriotic War. «Memory Road» is a publicly accessible single database of each participant. On the territory of the Patriot military-patriotic park of culture and recreation, the Main Church of the Armed Forces of Russia is being built in the form of the largest monument with the names and portraits of the heroes of the Great Patriotic War. There is already a gallery of participants in the war, and there I found information about my grandfather Zinulla Istayev, who heroically fought for his homeland.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		As soon as my grandfather was 18 years old, he was drafted into the Red Army. It was in November 1944, and from that moment his combat biography began. He fought for several months, liberating Europe from the fascist plague. He was a machine gunner of the 339th  Infantry Regiment of the 120th  Guards Rifle Division. Then I learned from a search engine that the regiment in which my grandfather Zinulla Istayev served had a heroic history since 1942. It began with the defense of Stalingrad. But then my grandfather was still a teenager, and he was sent to this regiment when the Nazi troops were finally expelled from Soviet territory, the state border of the USSR was completely restored and military operations were transferred to German territory. The full actual name is the 339th Guards Rifle Red Banner, Orders of Suvorov, Kutuzov and Alexander Nevsky Regiment. The regiment in which my grandfather fought participated in battles to expand the Ruzhany bridgehead on the west bank of the Narev River, in the East Prussian offensive operation from January to April 1945, defeated the Nazis in Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad), successfully crossed the Spree River and then fought fierce battles to destroy an enemy grouping, surrounded southeast of Berlin. And again, returning to the award sheet, I found out that my grandfather was seriously injured. He was treated in the sorting evacuation hospital №282.
	</p>
	<img src="/upload/medialibrary/753/IMG_20200326_WA0045.jpg" class="img-left">
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		The award sheet describes his feat: «I participated for mastering Berlin. On April 24, he was seriously wounded in the stomach with damage to the intestines and pelvic bones. He was admitted to the hospital in serious condition. Twice undergone surgery. Wound healing was complicated by suppuration. Health status is currently improving. For his active participation in the battles for the Soviet Motherland in the Great Patriotic War and how he received a severe wound, he is worthy of being awarded the Order of the Red Star. The award sheet was signed by the head of the department, Major of the Medical Service Holmberg, deputy head of the sorting evacuation hospital, captain Tsvetkov and head of the sorting evacuation hospital №282, Lt. Col. Levin. And only on December 14, 1945, in Potsdam, the order of the commander-in-chief of a group of Soviet occupation forces in Germany was signed on awarding Soviet soldiers. Among them was our hero. On behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for the exemplary performance of combat missions of the command at the front of the fight against the German invaders and the valor and courage shown, the Red Army soldier Istayev Zinulla - machine gunner of the 339th  Rifle Regiment of the 120th Guards Rifle Division was awarded the Order of the Red Star.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		He healed his wounds for a long time. Demobilized in 1946, and in the same year began working at the Guryev oil refinery. From 1946 to March 1973 he worked as an operator of workshop №4. In 1948 he created a family. He raised seven children: 4 daughters and 3 sons. His eldest daughter Bayan Istaeva worked at this plant in 1968-1977 as a pourer, but, unfortunately, she suddenly died in 1977. 
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		My grandfather Zinulla Istayev did not live long, died at the age of 47 after a long illness, and military injuries were evidently affected. 
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		My mother Zhumabike is the daughter of Zinulla Istayev. Our family always carefully treats the memory of relatives. Mom is proud that her father is a war hero, and I am proud of my grandfather.

		Over the past few years, 9th of May has been a parade of the immortal regiment in the central streets of many countries. This movement in its modern form began in 2011 in Tomsk and was initiated by journalists Sergey Lapenkov, Sergey Kolotovkin and Igor Dmitriev. They noticed that fewer and fewer veterans were taking part in street marches on Victory Day, and decided to restore justice: heroes who defended the country’s freedom should see a celebration, even with photographs. In 2012 more than six thousand people took part in the action, which received the name «Immortal Regiment». Many cities and countries took this action. All cities in Kazakhstan have such marches on Victory Day or on the eve of the celebration – 8th of May.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Our family participated for the first time in such a march in 2017 in Moscow. We started immediately from the capital of the Russian Federation - Moscow. More than 800,000 people participated that year. Together with us, the envoys from the republics of the post-Soviet space, from Germany, France, Israel and others walked through the Red Square. 
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Before the trip, we were told that no one would let you in, that you had to register and only after confirmation can you be accepted. None of this happened.  We walked to Tverskaya Street, let us through the metal detector and poured into a living river. The music of the war years was heard everywhere, and on the ice screens there were documentary chronicles, war feature films. Many of the marchers were wearing military uniforms from the 1940 year. The marchers were small to great. The fathers carried their young children on their shoulders. The windows of the houses, the doors of the balconies were wide open and in them we saw portraits of the participants of the war. They were held by elderly people, apparently because of their health, they could not walk the streets. I remember an elderly woman standing on one balcony, wiping tears on her face and holding a large portrait of a man in military uniform. His breasts were full of medals and orders. When I saw her mourning, tears rolled out of my eyes. 9th of May  was indeed a holiday with tears in my eyes. 
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Portraits of my grandfather Oraz Mukanov and my uncle Katen Gabbasov were carried by my husband Abdullah Gabbasov. His grandfather was drafted into the active army in the winter of 1942, and was demobilized exactly one year later due to a serious injury to his right arm. According to him, a German shell hit the trench and exploded near it. The shrapnel hit his arm, he continued to participate in the attack, and it was only when he was exhausted from a great loss of blood that he was taken to the hospital, and then he was called away. Before the war, my grandfather worked as a teacher, but after the injury he couldn’t hold the chalk in his hand, write on the blackboard, and his left hand couldn’t do it, so he changed his profession. Katen went through the war, ended it in Czechoslovakia. When Ukraine was liberated, he met a Ukrainian girl there and wanted to marry and bring her home, but her parents wouldn’t let him. And he got married, lived his whole life as a bachelor.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		The portrait of his grandfather Zholaman Yesenov was carried by his grandson Maulen Gabbasov. Grandfather Maulen, my father, after short-term courses at the Guryev Military Infantry School, was sent to Stalingrad. After the first battle, two men remained from the platoon, as he recalled. «It was a meat grinder», said the father. Then there was a wound, a hospital. Father, as a literate person who knows the Kazakh and Russian languages, has education (teacher training and military infantry schools) was then sent to Orenburg to participate in the training of junior sergeants. In November 1946, he was discharged. He was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War.

		I carried a portrait of my own uncle Amanzhol Sultangaliev. He is the elder brother of my father, bore the name of his grandfather. In the spring of 1941 he was called up for service, passed it in Belarus. And then he retreated to Moscow. December 12, 1941 he was gone. He died defending Moscow. He was then incomplete 20 years.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">

	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		For a long time our illustrious fathers and grandfathers went to another world, but we remember them. And while we will remember them, remember, they are alive. This year, the year of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, we again decided to take part in the march on Red Square. They began to prepare in January, but today's realities are such that we are not going anywhere.

As soon as he was 18 years old in 1943, he was drafted into the Red Army. Only the elderly, women and children remained on the collective farm where he lived. All men went to the front.

		The Great Patriotic War! How much grief this brutal and merciless war brought. How much suffering fell on the shoulders of our people! How many maternal tears were shed, how much blood was shed. All the families of the Soviet Union suffered in that formidable and cruel time. Parents have lost their daughters and sons, their wife – husbands, children – parents.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Young people of the twenty-first century learn about that terrible and merciless war from the stories of loved ones, books, films, television programs. We live in peacetime, but we must know and remember how incredible efforts this peaceful sky above our heads was worth. Life without war was given to us by those guys and girls who met it in those distant forties. Now they are veterans of the Great Patriotic War. They got a hard share. Unfortunately, very few surviving veterans ...

	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">

		I believe in human memory, in the ability to love and compassion. The eternal flame of love and memory should always burn in our hearts and in the hearts of future generations as a sign of great gratitude to all who defended peace and happiness on Earth. I feel like a tiny particle of our people, and when these particles come together, they become a single community, an invincible force, which the invading enemies were so afraid of.

	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		Each of us is the heir to the Victory, therefore, we must remember those who conquered our peaceful life!

		Many folded their heads for our Great Motherland. They died for us, their descendants. The greater responsibility lies with us, the younger generation. We must prove that we are worthy heirs of the Victory, so that our descendants can be proud of us just as we are proud of the glory of our ancestors.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
		I want to say to our dear veterans: «Thank you so much for your feat!» and wish you longevity, health and a peaceful sky above your head!
